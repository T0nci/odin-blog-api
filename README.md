# Blog API

Blog API was a fun project where through challenges and struggle I learnt a lot of things:

- writing a RESTful API
- creating and verifying JWTs for authentication
- connecting the front-end to the API
- exploring more testing options(namely `createMemoryBrowser`)
- implementing and working with a cloud-based [WYSIWYG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG) editor(TinyMCE)

This Jamstack project is a website consisting of 3 parts:

- RESTful API back-end(this repository)
- viewer front-end where users can
  - view all blogs
  - view a blog
  - comment on a blog(if user is logged in)
- author back-end where the author can
  - write, edit and delete blogs
  - delete comments
